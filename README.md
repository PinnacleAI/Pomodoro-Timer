<h1>Pomodoro Timer</h1>

<p>
    This project is an implementation of the amazing Pomodoro Technique
    designed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique is used to increase your focus
    and productivity when working, it is a technique that has been of very
    immense help to me

</p>

<h3>Short Description</h3>
<p>
    Humans have short focus span and attempting to force yourself to
    concentrate on a particular task for a long period of time will only lead
    to increase errors and lower productivity.
</p>
<p>
    The Pomodoro Technique mitigate this by breaking the long period of 
    concentration into a series of shorter period (4) follow by a more shorter
    period of rest (or breaks). This technique is known to dramatically
    increase your focus and productivity when trying to complete assignments
    or meet deadlines.
</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>
The typical process of the Pomodoro Technique consists of the following six step:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Choose a task that you would like to finish.</li>
    <li>Set the Pomodoro Timer for 25 minutes </li>
    <li>Work solely on that task until the timer rings</li>
    <li>After the timer rings, make a checkmark on a piece of paper.</li>
    <li>Take a short break. You could use this time to mediate, exercise,
        do anything as long as it is not the current task you are working on
    </li>
    <li>Once you have completed four Pomodoro cycles, you deserve a longer
        break.
    </li>
</ol>
